## My process

The layout process was quite simple, with minimal complications.

The layout is done in HTML trying to respect the semantics, then the CSS code is used where the variables for the color are defined, the font is called locally and the assembly process begins.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

My biggest obstacle was getting the image to attach to the container, the rest was pretty easy.

I took the opportunity to improve my use of variables, and I could have used variables to call the sources, which I will do in the next exercises.
